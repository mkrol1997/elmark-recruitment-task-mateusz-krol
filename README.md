# Overview

The Elmark Warehouse Management REST API, is a tool for managing parts and categories within a warehouse environment.
This API provides a set of endpoints to facilitate the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
along with advanced collection filtering capabilities.

## Technologies Used

Built using technologies, including:

- **Django REST Framework**:
DRF is a framework, built on top of Django. This integration allows for consistency in the development stack,
ensuring a unified and coherent architecture for both web and API components promoting code reusability.
The stability of the framework is beneficial for projects requiring robust and reliable solutions.
The well-maintained and comprehensive documentation makes it easier for developers to understand the framework, learn its features,
and troubleshoot issues effectively. The built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provides a clean and expressive syntax
for database queries, reducing its complexity.
- **mongoengine**: Python Object-Document Mapper (ODM) library for MongoDB.
It allows to interact with MongoDB using pre-defined document models, providing a high-level abstraction for working with MongoDB documents.
Define MongoDB document models using Python classes. Fields allow to define data types, validation rules, and relationships.
- **django-rest-framework-mongoengine:** Provides serializers that can handle mongoengine document models, assuring
consistent way to perform CRUD operations on MongoDB documents using DRF patterns.
- **django-mongoengine-filter:** provides filtering capabilities for
MongoDB using mongoengine. It enables to filter queryset results based on specific criteria,
making it easier to retrieve the desired data from a MongoDB collection.
Simplifies MongoDB document filtering using pre-defined filter classes.
- **drf-yasg:**  Django REST Framework extension that generates Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for API.
It provides a clean and interactive UI for exploring and testing API endpoints.
Automatically generates Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for your DRF API.
Allows to easily share comprehensive API documentation with developers and clients.
- **Docker :** Providing containerization and deployment simplifying, ensuring cross-platform deployment consistency.
- **Pipenv:** Automatically creates and manages project virtual environment. Allows packages management from Pipfile.
- **pre-commit:** Automatically run hooks before each commit to enforce code standards ensuring code consistency, linting, and other checks.

      ```
    - Required variables:
       ```bash
         - SECRET_KEY: Django web app secret key
         - DB_HOST: MongoDB Database connection uri [ex. mongodb://<username>:<password>@<database_host>:<port>/]
         - DB_NAME: Database name
       ```
4. **Build Docker Image:**
